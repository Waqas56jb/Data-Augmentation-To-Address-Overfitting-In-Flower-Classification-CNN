This project focuses on enhancing image classification models using various data augmentation techniques to improve robustness and accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Implementation of various data augmentation methods such as rotation, zoom, horizontal flip, and brightness adjustment to enhance the training dataset.
- **Efficient Pipelines**: Utilization of TensorFlow and Keras pipelines to streamline the augmentation process and integrate seamlessly with the training workflow.
- **Insightful Visualization**: Visualization of augmented images and performance metrics using Matplotlib to understand the effects of augmentation on model training.
- **Improved Model Performance**: Significant improvement in model accuracy and generalization through augmented data.
